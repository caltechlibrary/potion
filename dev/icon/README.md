Icon sources for Zuppa
==========================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/term/potion/150643/) of a bottle of potion, used as the icon for this repository, was created by [Lee Mette](https://thenounproject.com/leemette/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS, to change the icon color to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.
