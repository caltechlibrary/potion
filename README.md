Introduction
------------

[TIND](https://tind.io) is an [integrated library system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_library_system). The Caltech Library uses a hosted solution by TIND for its [library catalog](https://caltech.tind.io).  Recent versions of TIND provide a REST API for getting a subset of information using network calls.  To make writing interfaces and automation scripts in Python easier, the Caltech Library [Digital Library Development team](https://www.library.caltech.edu/staff?&field_directory_department%5B0%5D=754) developed Potion (_"**P**ython **o**bjects for **TI**ND **o**peratio**n**s"_), a Python package that provides an object-oriented interface to data in a TIND catalog.

Potion is not a complete API for interacting with TIND instances.  At this time, it provides an interface for retrieving only  two kinds of objects: bibliographic records, and items/holdings associated with those records.
